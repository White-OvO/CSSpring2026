#C++ Lab: OSRS Magic Max Hit Table

#lab 2


Purpose
This lab introduces you to using <iomanip> and <cmath> in C++ for output formatting and mathematical computation. You will write a program that calculates magic max hit values in Old School RuneScape, organizing the results into a neatly formatted table using output manipulators like setw, setfill, and justification directives (left, right).

Beyond this example, the same skills apply in real-world programming careers, especially in game development. Designers and analysts often need to generate and present tables of stats—damage values, probability charts, or balancing metrics—for their team leads or bosses. Mastering formatted output now gives you the ability to clearly communicate complex calculations later in a professional setting.

C++ Lab: Choosing Combat

Purpose
In this lab you will validate a single integer input and handle type/range errors, drive a tiny menu with a single switch, and use a nested selection inside one case to adjust behavior. These patterns matter because real programs must guard bad inputs first, then branch cleanly based on a user’s choice—think menus, CLI tools, config flags, and game actions. You’ll reuse the same validation-then-branch structure in upcoming work (loops, functions, structs), and this habit of checking inputs early and isolating decisions will make your code easier to test, grade, and debug later. This also maps directly to everyday tasks like form validation, command handling, and event routing in production code.
