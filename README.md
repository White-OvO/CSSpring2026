C++ Lab: Choosing Combat

#Purpose
In this lab you will validate a single integer input and handle type/range errors, drive a tiny menu with a single switch, and use a nested selection inside one case to adjust behavior. These patterns matter because real programs must guard bad inputs first, then branch cleanly based on a user’s choice—think menus, CLI tools, config flags, and game actions. You’ll reuse the same validation-then-branch structure in upcoming work (loops, functions, structs), and this habit of checking inputs early and isolating decisions will make your code easier to test, grade, and debug later. This also maps directly to everyday tasks like form validation, command handling, and event routing in production code.
